🧠 n8n in Docker — Explained Simply

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool, like Zapier — it connects different apps and automates repetitive tasks without code.

When we use Docker to run n8n, it gives us:

Quick setup (no manual Node.js or database install)

Clean environment (everything inside a container)

Portability (run it on any system instantly)

Persistent data (through Docker volumes)

⚙️ Why Use Docker for n8n?
Feature	Description
🐳 Simple Installation	One docker-compose up -d command runs the full n8n server.
🔒 Environment Variables	Easily set username, password, timezone, and other configs in docker-compose.yml.
💾 Persistent Data	Store workflows safely in Docker volumes so they aren’t lost when restarting.
🔗 Easy Integration	Connect n8n to databases, APIs, and other services (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) using Docker networks.
⚡ Lightweight & Scalable	Add more services or scale containers anytime without reinstalling.
💡 In Short:

n8n + Docker = Fast, portable, and self-contained automation environment.
No need to configure servers — just run your automation tool inside a container and start creating workflows instantly.
