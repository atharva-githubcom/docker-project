🐳 MongoDB with Docker — In Short

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, and running it inside Docker makes setup super easy — no manual installation, no dependency issues.

Instead of installing MongoDB manually on your system, Docker:

Pulls the MongoDB image from Docker Hub

Creates an isolated container for it

Lets you connect via port mapping (27017)

Saves your data using volumes so it’s not lost when the container stops

⚙️ Why Use MongoDB in Docker?
Feature	Description
🧩 Isolation	MongoDB runs independently in its own container — no conflict with other apps.
🚀 Fast Setup	One docker-compose up -d command, and it’s ready to use.
💾 Persistent Data	Data is stored in Docker volumes (even after the container stops).
🔗 Easy Integration	Works seamlessly with other containers (like Mongo Express, Node.js, Flask, etc.) through Docker networks.
🔗 Example in Our Project

In our docker-compose.yml, we run:

One container for MongoDB

One for Mongo Express (UI for Mongo)
Both are connected through a Docker network so they can communicate internally.

💡 In Short:

MongoDB in Docker = Fast, clean, portable setup of your database.
Perfect for developers who don’t want messy manual installs — just run, connect, and build.
